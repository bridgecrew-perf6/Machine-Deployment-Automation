# Machine-Deployment-Automation

Both of these codes are used in JumpCloud to automate both Mac and Windows machine deployment.
They both are used in the "Commands" section and install the following:
  - Google Chrome
  - Google Drive
  - Slack
  - Zoom
  - Microsoft Office
  - Sentinel One
  - *For Mac machines, the dock is also reorganized for company specific apps

Still a work in progress and being updated from time to time to fit company standards!
